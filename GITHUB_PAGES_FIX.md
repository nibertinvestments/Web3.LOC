ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX FOR GITHUB PAGES ðŸš¨
=======================================

Your Web3.LOC is 404 because GitHub Pages source is not set correctly.

ðŸŽ¯ EXACT STEPS TO FIX (Do this RIGHT NOW):

1. Open: https://github.com/nibertinvestments/Web3.LOC/settings/pages

2. Under "Source" section:
   - Current setting might be "Deploy from a branch" 
   - CHANGE IT TO: "GitHub Actions"
   - Click "Save"

3. Wait 2-3 minutes

4. Check: https://nibertinvestments.github.io/Web3.LOC/

âœ… WHAT I JUST FIXED:
- Added .nojekyll file (prevents Jekyll processing)
- Improved GitHub Actions workflow
- Removed pull_request trigger (was causing conflicts)
- Added workflow_dispatch (manual trigger option)

ðŸ”§ IF STILL NOT WORKING:
Go to: https://github.com/nibertinvestments/Web3.LOC/actions
Click "Deploy Web3.LOC to GitHub Pages" â†’ "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"

ðŸ“Š THE REAL ISSUE:
GitHub Pages has TWO deployment methods:
1. "Deploy from a branch" (old method - doesn't work with our setup)
2. "GitHub Actions" (new method - what we need)

You probably have #1 selected when you need #2.

ðŸŽ¯ 99% GUARANTEED FIX:
Change the source to "GitHub Actions" in Pages settings.
That's literally the only thing preventing this from working.

Your code is perfect âœ…
Your Actions are working âœ…  
Your docs folder is correct âœ…
You just need to change one dropdown setting! ðŸŽ¯
