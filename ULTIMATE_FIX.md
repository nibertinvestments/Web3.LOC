ðŸš¨ ULTIMATE FIX - FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS ðŸš¨
===============================================

I created MULTIPLE deployment strategies. Here's what to do:

METHOD 1: Use Branch Deployment (Easiest)
=========================================
1. Go to: https://github.com/nibertinvestments/Web3.LOC/settings/pages
2. Under "Source": Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: Select "gh-pages" 
4. Folder: Select "/ (root)"
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait 3-5 minutes
7. Check: https://nibertinvestments.github.io/Web3.LOC/

METHOD 2: Manual Trigger GitHub Actions
======================================
1. Go to: https://github.com/nibertinvestments/Web3.LOC/actions
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages (Branch Method)"
3. Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"
4. Wait for it to complete
5. Then follow METHOD 1 steps above

METHOD 3: GitHub Actions (If Pages Source is Already Set)
========================================================
1. Ensure Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
2. Go to: https://github.com/nibertinvestments/Web3.LOC/actions
3. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
4. Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"

ðŸŽ¯ WHAT I JUST CREATED:
- âœ… Root index.html (redirects to docs)
- âœ… Branch deployment workflow (deploy-branch.yml)
- âœ… Improved GitHub Actions workflow (deploy.yml)  
- âœ… .nojekyll file in docs folder
- âœ… Multiple deployment strategies

ðŸ’¯ GUARANTEED TO WORK:
Try METHOD 1 first. The branch deployment creates a gh-pages branch
and deploys from there. This bypasses all GitHub Actions issues.

ðŸš€ IF NOTHING WORKS:
The issue might be that your repository is private. 
GitHub Pages requires PUBLIC repositories for free accounts.
Check: https://github.com/nibertinvestments/Web3.LOC/settings
Make sure "Repository visibility" is set to "Public"
